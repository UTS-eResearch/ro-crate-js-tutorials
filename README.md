# ro-crate-js-tutorials

This repository contains examples of programing using the node libraries ro-crate and ro-crate-html-js. 

The [first tutorial](./tutorial1.js) shows how to use `ro-crate` to crate an RO-Crate object, add metadata to make a minimum viable crate, and how to add contents - the code has comments to explain what's going on. Please give feedback using github issues.

To run it first install this library:

`npm install .`

Then:

`node tutorial1.js`
